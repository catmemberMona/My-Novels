                A wide leather [belt] is tied around her waist knotted in the back with thin ropes.  <br>
                She often uses the leather belt to hold objects and hidden weapons. She would always be seen wearing a green sliver bracelet that she doesn't allow others to touch. <!--present from her parents-->
